The osmotic pressure formula stablishes the amount of force applied to a solution that prevents solvent from moving across a semipermeable membrane. Osmotic pressure can be expressed in ay unit of pressure (pa, atm, etc). Osmotic Pressure (pi) = MRT where M stands for the molar concentration of the solutes (mol/L), R is the ideal gas constant (J/molxK) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (K).


Min/Maxes:

Temperature -> Min: 0K
Concentration of Solutes -> Min: 0 mol/L
